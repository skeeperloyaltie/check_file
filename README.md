## Program sample
- Two frogs are sitting at bottom of a flight of 10 steps and debating in how many ways can they jump up the stairs. They can jump one, two or three steps at a time. For example they can cover the 10 steps by jumping (3, 3, 3 , 1) or (2 ,3, 3, 2) or other suitable combinations.
1. Work out a recursive function that provides a general solution (not only for 10 but for general n steps). Note that (3,3,3,1) is distinct from (1,3,3,3) and that we only want to count the number of solutions and not report the solutions.
2. Encouraged by your solution, one of the frogs becomes more ambitious and tries to find out the answer for n = 100 and runs out of patience. Provide an alternate (faster) algorithm to help the poor frog.
